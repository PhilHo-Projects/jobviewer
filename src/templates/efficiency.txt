Subject: {{title}} Application - Philippe Ho

Hi Hiring Manager,

I’ve been following {{company}}’s work. I’m applying for the {{title}} role because I specialize in bridging the gap between complex game logic and cloud-based infrastructure.

Why I’m a fit for this role:
* Shipped Experience: I recently delivered a completed game on Steam, managing everything from UI systems to asset pipelines in Unity and C#.
* Cloud & Networking: I have hands-on experience building automated matchmaking and multiplayer systems using Unity Cloud APIs and AWS.
* AI-Driven Development: I leverage AI tools (Claude, Cursor, n8n) to rapidly prototype and solve technical integration issues, meaning I spend less time stuck and more time shipping code.

My resume covers my background in Game Development and Full-Stack automation, but I’d love to show you how I can apply my experience to your current pipeline.

Best,

Philippe Ho
